## How to Use the Auto Faucet

1. Ensure Python and Git are installed on your device.  

2. Clone this repository:  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akasakaid/lazy-megaeth.git
    ```  

3. Navigate to the `lazy-megaeth` folder:  

    ```bash
    cd lazy-megaeth
    ```  

4. Install the required libraries:  

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```  

5. Run the auto faucet claim program:  

    ```bash
    python faucet.py
    ```  

Since each IP address is only allowed to claim once per day, use proxies to claim multiple times with different wallet addresses. Check the [Proxy Providers](#proxy-providers) section for recommendations.
